What is identifiers in python and provide me rules for the same?

Identifiers are names given to entities like variables, functions, classes, etc. in a programming language. They follow certain rules to ensure readability and consistency. Here are some rules for identifiers:

1. Identifiers must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9) or an underscore (_).
2. Identifiers can not start with digit.
3. Identifiers are case-sensitive (identifier1 and Identifiers, FirstName, FIRSTNAME, firstname are different).
4. you can not use keywords as an identifiers.
5. Identifiers can be of any length.
6. white-space are not allowed.
7. Identifiers can contain special characters such as $, @, #, %, etc. but they should not start with them.

Examples of valid identifiers:
    - my_variable
    - MyVariable
    - level_1
    - _private_variable

Examples of invalid identifiers:
