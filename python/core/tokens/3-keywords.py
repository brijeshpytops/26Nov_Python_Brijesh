>>> help()
Welcome to Python 3.12's help utility! If this is your first time using
Python, you should definitely check out the tutorial at
https://docs.python.org/3.12/tutorial/.

Enter the name of any module, keyword, or topic to get help on writing
Python programs and using Python modules.  To get a list of available
modules, keywords, symbols, or topics, enter "modules", "keywords",
"symbols", or "topics".

Each module also comes with a one-line summary of what it does; to list
the modules whose name or summary contain a given string such as "spam",
enter "modules spam".

To quit this help utility and return to the interpreter,
enter "q" or "quit".

4] write a keywords and hit enter

Here is a list of the Python keywords.  Enter any keyword to get more help.

# False: Represents the boolean value False.

# class: Used to define a class, e.g., class MyClass:.

# from: Imports specific parts of a module, e.g., from math import pi.

# or: Logical operator to evaluate one of two conditions, e.g., True or False.

# None: Represents the absence of a value, e.g., x = None.

# continue: Skips the rest of the loop iteration, e.g., continue.

# global: Declares a global variable, e.g., global x.

# pass: Acts as a placeholder, e.g., pass.

# True: Represents the boolean value True.

# def: Defines a function, e.g., def my_function():.

# if: Starts a conditional statement, e.g., if x > 5:.

# raise: Raises an exception, e.g., raise ValueError.

# and: Logical operator to evaluate two conditions, e.g., True and False.

# del: Deletes an object, e.g., del x.

# import: Imports a module, e.g., import os.

# return: Exits a function and optionally returns a value, e.g., return 5.

# as: Used to create an alias, e.g., import math as m.

# elif: Adds another conditional statement, e.g., elif x == 5:.

# in: Tests for membership, e.g., if 'a' in 'apple':.

# try: Starts a try block for exception handling, e.g., try:.

# assert: Tests a condition and raises an exception if false, e.g., assert x > 0.

# else: Provides a fallback for conditional or try statements, e.g., else:.

# is: Tests for identity, e.g., if x is y:.

# while: Starts a while loop, e.g., while x < 10:.

# async: Defines an asynchronous function, e.g., async def fetch_data():.

# except: Catches exceptions in a try block, e.g., except ValueError:.

# lambda: Creates an anonymous function, e.g., lambda x: x + 1.

# with: Manages resources, e.g., with open('file.txt') as f:.

# await: Awaits an asynchronous operation, e.g., await task.

# finally: Ensures a block of code runs after try-except, e.g., finally:.

# nonlocal: Refers to a variable in an enclosing scope, e.g., nonlocal x.

# yield: Returns a generator value, e.g., yield x.

# break: Exits a loop prematurely, e.g., break.

# for: Starts a for loop, e.g., for i in range(5):.

# not: Logical operator to negate a condition, e.g., not True.
